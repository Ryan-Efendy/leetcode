        we want i, j, k to be as close as possible. init i, j, k = 0, 0, 0. Approach is either increase lower or upper bound b/c we are starting at 0, we can only increase lower.
        
        1. Find max, min from the first elements of all the lists
        3. get range = max - min, keep track minRange
        4. pop min & insert next num from the list that had min removed
        5. Repeat: Compute max, min and range again until one of the list is done being computed
